# hello-world
time to follow the bouncing doc guide
is this the social media "who am i" profile source of github?  either way, here are a few things about me:
  - computer engineer from ye olde processors
    - 6800 was current, 6809 was advanced, and 68000 was the future
    - sad how the future sometime disappoints...
    - as Mike Swaine reported once, "We can't predict the future, but we can create it."
  - military pilot (helicopters: Sea King; Griffon; drones: Sperwer; Heron;)
  - computer pursuits:
    - Novell CNE (not a paper one)
    - Nortel PBX admin programmer (scripted bulk migration and changes that were unsupported)
    - computer telephony integration programming/install/debug/maintain (eventually included outdial servers to phone you during dinner)
    - network architecture design/maintenance (real time financial data distributer when it was hard)
    - software distribution (bank client/server system)
    - geographic information systems (this is where i am now)
